Welcome to a little example of My Style Cucumber framework with Page Object Model.

Due to only one test case I was not able to showcase all possible Patterns, Methods and Designs
But I tried my best to add a couple anyways.

You will be able to clone this Maven project from git hub to any OS.

To Run test you have 2 fastest ways: from Maven plugin - > test(top right corner)
or from Runner class under runners in java pakage.

Please also take a look at feature file under features in resources directory.
This is show case of BDD.

Thank you!
